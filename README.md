<h2>Sudoku Solvers in Python</h2>

the "solver_input" solver allows you to input the rows of a sudoku, and it will print the solution to the terminal. More user friendly than solver_terminal.

the "solver_terminal" solver has the sudoku grid hard-coded into the program. I used this version for early testing of the program, to ensure it was working.
